# assembly_C_project
Brief Description:

- A text file I/O demo for Linux, using NASM 2.13.02

- The program does the following: 

(1) Reads a text file that does not have numbers prepend in front of its lines. 

(2) Writes it out again with line numbers. 

(3) Allow the user to enter on the command-line the name of the new file that will contain the modified text. 

(4) Small help system that guides the user when they need to.

- NOTE: This project is the solution to the problem/challenge that was introduced by Jeff Duntemann in his book on page 495.
