# assembly_C_project
A text file I/O demo for Linux, using NASM 2.13.02

The program does the following:
 (1)Reads a txt file that does not have numbers prepend in front of its lines.
 (2)Write it out again with line numbers.
 (3)Allow the user to enter on the command-line the name of the new file that will contain the modified txt.
 (4)Small help system that instructs and guides the user when they need.
 
NOTE: This project is the solution for the problem/challeng that was intoduced by Jeff Duntemann in his book (Assembly Language Step by Step Programming with Linux - Third Edition) page #495.
